/* Write a program that processes a given string to determine:
 The first non-repeating character (if present). 1.
 The most repeated character in the string. 2.
 If multiple characters have the same highest frequency, print the first non-repeating
 character first, then the most repeated character.
 3.
 If the input string is empty, print "Invalid Input". 4.
 If all characters in the string are repeating, print "None" followed by the most repeating
 character.
 5.
 Enter a string: swissmississippi
 Output
 First Non-Repeating Character: w 
Most Repeated Character: s (appears 7 times)
